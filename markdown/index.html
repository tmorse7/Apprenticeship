<h1>About Markdown</h1>

<p>Markdown is a programming language that lets you make simple HTML based changes to text documents which use the file type of .md. To me, it feels almost like a shorthand version of HTML formatting.</p>
<p>Some notable syntax that Markdown uses are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Headers: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</li>
  <li>Bold: **(text)** or __(text)__</li>
  <li>Italic: *(text)* or _(text)_</li>
  <li>Ordered List: 1. (text) (ENTER)</li>
  <li>Unordered List: * or - (text) (ENTER)</li>
  <li>Links: [text](link)</li>
  <li>Images: ![alt text*](link)</li>
  <li>Referencing: [reference variable] and then later defined: [ref var]: reference item</li>
</ul>
<p>* Alt text is the text that appears when the image isn't loaded.</p>
<p>One big thing to note is that if you double space after something, it will create a new line. This comes into use with this like lists.</p>
