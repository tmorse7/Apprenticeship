  <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Howdy! My name is Tristan Morse. I'm a computer science: information systems major and a new media minor at UNC Asheville. I am the salutatorian of my graduating class and was part of the National Honors Society. During my time in high school, I programmed on my own time, which is how I developed the interest in this field. Now I've made my own computer and have made personal coding projects! Enough about me though. The blog needs some explaining! This blog is a place where I can post my notes from my internship with Herrmann International, so I can always come back and look at it for reference as well as show future employers my handywork with making a website! This webpage uses coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Ruby.</p>
