<h1>About Jekyll</h1>

<p>Jekyll is static website framework that can be downloaded as a ruby gem to make webpages such as this one! It is able to create a webpage through the use of command line combining file types of many sorts such as html, css, Markdown, and Javascript (there's probably more). I've been using a local host preview to edit this site.</p>

<p>Some commands to remember are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Installing Jekyll (linux/MAC): gem jekyll install</li>
  <li>Create Jekyll Source Folder: jekyll build</li>
  <li>Launch Jekyll Site: jekyll serve (--watch)*</li>
</ul>
<p>* --watch used to update on refresh, which is optional.</p>
