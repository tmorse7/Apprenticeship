# Questions:

1. What is a git commit?  

  A) A git commit is a way of saving changes that were made to a file to its respected branch. It is often followed
     by a message stating what changes were made.
2. What is Github? Do you need it to use git? Why or why not?  

  A) Github is a website used to remotely work on repositories and files. This lets the user work collaboratively over
     the internet on such repositories. You do not, however, need github to be able to use git. Git is its own software
     that can actually work with other online repository editing sites such as bitbucket. You are able to change your
     'remote' at any time, letting you push to other sites that let you host and edit repositories online.
3. Why do you think we are using something like git rather than just having a 'save' command for all the files in a
   project?  

  A) I'm assuming that the reasoning behind using git is to be able to have thorough and clean version control, just
     case something were to break. By using Git and making all sorts of branches, we can experiment a lot more with
     the files that we have without actually manipulating the main branch until we actually know that the changes work
     or if we want them in the main branch in the first place.
