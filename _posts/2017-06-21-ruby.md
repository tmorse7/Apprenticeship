# Some Thoughts on Ruby

So far from what I've experienced, I really like Ruby. Within the lessons that I have already done, I've seen a lot of common themes that most programming languages share such as types, classes, methods, etc. That part of it feels very familiar to what I've previously experienced in programming languages like Processing, Java, and Python. I've noticed in particular that Ruby is extremely similar to Python in how it works, except there is a key difference: Ruby doesn't rely on indentation. Instead, it has an actual ```end``` point. This makes it helpful to know that you have an actual physical representation to the end of a class or a function. This makes things easier to debug. I haven't done much in Python so far, so maybe I'm not able to fully judge it yet. I just know that so far, I'm really digging Ruby, and wonder what Ruby on Rails is like in comparison as well as how they work together.
