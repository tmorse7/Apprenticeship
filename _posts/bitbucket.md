# Bitbucket vs. Github Interface Thoughts

Compared to Github, Bitbucket seems to be more bare bones with its features. I
feel like with Bitbucket, everything is slimmed down to where most of what you
need is able to be accessed on the side. Github on the other hand seems to have
a lot of content, but it's more spread out. I do like that Bitbucket provides
free, private repositories, which is in contrast with Github. This provides
a nice private space for personal projects. For Github, I would see it to be
very useful if it were used to work publically and collaboratively on projects
as well as an online code portfolio.
